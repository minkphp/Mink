1.8.1 / 2020-03-11
==================

1.8.0 / 2020-03-11
==================

New features:

* Auto-start the session on first call to `visit`. `Mink::getSession()` will no longer start the session automatically.
* Added support for `symfony/css-selector` 4 and 5

Bug fixes:

* Fixed the message when reporting the deprecation of `ExpectationException::getSession()`
* Fixed support for XPath selectors using `|` inside strings or conditions rather than as a top-level union
* Fixed compatibility with PHP 7.2 not allowing to use `count` on strings

Testsuite:

* Added PHP 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 in the CI
* Removed HHVM from CI as they stopped supporting PHP compatibility

Driver testsuite:

* The driver testsuite is no longer part of this package. Use `mink/driver-testsuite` to run driver tests instead.

Misc:

* Changed phpdoc types from `Boolean` to `boolean` to be compatible with psalm type checking

1.7.1 / 2016-03-05
==================

Bug fixes:

* Refactored the CssSelector to use the new API of the Symfony CssSelector component to be compatible with Symfony 3

Testsuite:

* Disallowed failures on PHP 7 on Travis (tests were passing since a long time)

Driver testsuite:

* Fixed the driver testsuite to account for driver inheritance when checking recommended practices
* Added a test for cookie values with semicolon, to ensure all drivers support it
* Improved the window resize test to consider headless browsers
* Fixed the compatibility of the testsuite with PHPUnit 5

* Added HTML escaping of submitted values in the driver testsuite web-fixtures

Misc:

* Removed the Mink testsuite from archives generated by Github to make them smaller

1.7.0 / 2015-09-20
==================

New features:

* Added `Session::getResponseHeader` to access a response header easily
* Added support for header assertions
* Added a forward compatibility layer for drivers to allow them to prepare
  for Mink 2.0 (they won't require any change if they use it). They should
  now overwrite `CoreDriver::findElementXpaths` instead of implementing `find`
  and `setSession` themselves.
* Added escaping of the locator in the NamedSelector rather than expecting
  the caller to perform the escaping. Passing an escaped locator is still
  supported but deprecated.
* Remove the dependency on the Session in expectation exceptions. Passing
  the session in the exception constructor is now deprecated. The driver
  should be passed instead.

Bug fixes:

* Fixed the URL assertions when comparing paths ending in ``.php``
* Silenced deprecation warnings (following the Symfony convention) to make
  them less invasive. Use the `symfony/phpunit-bridge` to get them reported
  when using Mink in your PHPUnit tests.
* Fixed `NodeElement::hasClass` in case the class attribute contains newlines

Testsuite:

* Made the testsuite compatible with PHPUnit strict timing mode (only the library testsuite, not the driver one)
* Added testing against PHP 7
* Added testing against lowest version of dependencies to ensure we got the lower bounds right

Driver testsuite:

* Added an extra test to ensure the right behavior when getting the HTML with empty elements
* Added a few more safeguards to ensure test failures rather than fatal errors for misbehaving drivers
* Added a test ensuring that drivers follow recommended practices

Misc:

* Added a few missing deprecation warnings for deprecated APIs or classes.

1.6.1 / 2015-02-04
==================

Bug fixes:

* Added a check for empty path in `WebAssert::cleanUrl()`

Driver testsuite:

Misc:

* Changed the description in the composer.json
* Switched the repository structure to use PSR-4
* Updated URLs for the move to the new Github organization

1.6.0 / 2014-09-26
==================

  * [BC break] Changed the named selector to prefer exact matches over partial matches
  * [BC break] Changed `NodeElement::getValue` for checkboxes to return the value rather than the checked state (use `isChecked` for that)
  * Fixed the XPath prefixing when searching inside an existing element
  * Refactored the driver testsuite entirely and expand it to cover drivers entirely (covering many more cases for consistency)
  * Changed `NodeElement::setValue` to support any fields rather than only input elements
  * Removed the wrapping of any driver-level exception in a MinkException on invalid usage as it was making the code too complex
  * Fixed the matching of the input type in the named selector to be case insensitive according to the HTML spec
  * Introduced `Behat\Mink\Selector\Xpath\Escaper` to allow reusing the XPath escaping
  * Deprecated `Element::getSession`. Code needing the session should get it from outside rather than the element
  * Changed ElementNotFoundException to extend from ExpectationException

  * Fixed the name selectors to match on the `placeholder` only for textual inputs
  * Enforced consistent behavior for drivers on 4xx and 5xx response to return the response rather than throwing an exception
  * Added `Element::waitFor` to allow retrying some code until it succeeds or the timeout is reached
  * Added `Element::isValid` to check whether an element still exists in the page
  * Made `Session::executeScript` compatible across drivers by ensuring they all support the same syntaxes for the JS expression
  * Made `Session::evaluateScript` compatible across drivers by ensuring they all support the same syntaxes for the JS expression
  * Removed `hasClass` from `DocumentElement` (instead of triggering a fatal error)
  * Added testing on HHVM to ensure consistency
  * Fixed `NodeElement::getTagName` to ensure that the tag name is lowercase for all drivers
  * Fixed `Element::hasAttribute` to ensure it supports attributes with an empty value
  * Fixed the `field` selector to avoid matching inputs with the type `submit` or `reset`
  * Changed the button XPath selection to accept `reset` buttons as well
  * Changed `Session::wait` to return the condition value rather than nothing
  * Added `Session::getWindowName` and `Session::getWindowNames` to get the name of the current and of all windows
  * Added `Session::maximizeWindow` to maximize the window
  * Added `NodeElement::isSelected` to check whether an `<option>` is selected
  * Added `NodeElement::submitForm` to allow submitting a form without using a button
  * Added assertions about the value of an attribute
  * Added the anchor in the assertion on the URL in `WebAssert`
