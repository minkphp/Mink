This is the fork of Mink library that supports PHP `^7.2` and `^8.0` and supports Symfony `^3.4`, `^4.4` and `^5.0`.

For the documentation, please [refer to the original repository](https://github.com/minkphp/Mink).

No updates other than Symfony compatibility will be provided, but this fork _might_ be synchronised with the original repository in the future.
